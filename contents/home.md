I am a Ph.D. student at [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/), advised by [Prof. Hae-Won Park](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q7v_ewQAAAAJ&hl=en). 
I received my B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from KAIST and started my graduate studies at [Dynamic Robot Control & Design (DRCD) Lab](https://dynamicrobot.kaist.ac.kr/).
My main research focuses on developing robust and adaptive control algorithm for legged systems using model- and learning-based methods.
